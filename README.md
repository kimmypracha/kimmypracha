## Hi everyone! I'm Pracha Promthaw (Kim). 

I'm currently interested in Human-centered Generative AI with self-evaluation and self-reasoning using self-supervised or weakly-supervised approach. Especially in creative and educational application. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about tool for fine-tuning LLM with RL paradigm. Outsides CS, I'm practicing drawing and writing a novel!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on research to improve LLM Evaluation for Self-Improving LLM.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project that looks fun! Feel free to contact me if you have some idea!
